# Plotly_deployment

## Overview of the Module 12 Challenge

This project has the purpose of building an interactive web page. Using d3 and plotly libraries we were able to get data from a JSON file and create three different plots. This visual representation of the data gives us a quick idea of the relationship between different types of bacteria in the belly button and how this changes with the area washing frequency. 

### Folders/Files

index.html

static Folder: CSS (style.css), images (bacteria.jpeg), and js (charts.js, samples.json)

## Results

It has an options menu and by selecting a new ID the data of three plots will be updated.

### Bar Chart

This chart shows the top 10 Bacteria Cultures found within a specific subject.

### Bubble Chart

This chart shows the OTU ID (the subject) on the x-axis and the quantity of each bacteria that was found. The bubble radio is directly related to the quantity.

### Gauge Chart

This chart shows the belly button washing frequency. The range goes from 0 to 10 and we added some colors so it is more visual to see the scrubs per week within that range.

## Summary

In this project, it was possible to combinate different tools to create a nice visual representation of some data and allow the user to interact with it by choosing different Subject IDs. it also has opportunities for improvement in styling and in being more friendly for the user.
